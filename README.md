## World Generator
This is my first major project, which I began in the Summer of 2025 to practice a lot of the knowledge I've learned over the last couple of years at university. 

### Instructions to Run
Either download the latest release and run the jar or download the code and run the main class in IntelliJ

### Features
* Generate a fully random 2d fractal map
* See different lenses of the world, including elevation, precipitation, river paths, temperature, biomes, and more
* Save and Load Worlds for future use

### Future Ideas
* Implement a history simulation, allowing for civilisations and people to rise and fall in a fantasy world
* Dynamic generation of cultures, religions, and more
* Recording this history so that it can be reviewed at a later date, seeing how different people lived their lives in an ever-changing world

### Problems
* This code has a lot of bloat that was originally going to be used and has yet to be cleaned up, especially in the history simulation section
* If you want to read this, most of the important code is located within the worldgenerator package, which does most of the heavy lifting
